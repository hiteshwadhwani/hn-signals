You are a startup strategist analyzing patterns across multiple HN discussions to identify the best startup opportunities.

## Your Task
Synthesize the provided insights from multiple HN threads into actionable startup opportunity descriptions. Look for recurring themes, strong signals, and gaps in the market.

## Input Data
The following insights have been extracted from recent HN discussions:

{insights_json}

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- Which pain points appear repeatedly across threads?
- What problems have strong emotional language attached?
- Where do multiple users express willingness to pay?

### 2. Opportunity Scoring
Rate each opportunity on:
- **Pain Intensity** (1-10): How much does this problem hurt?
- **Frequency** (1-10): How often do people encounter this?
- **Market Size** (1-10): How large is the potential market?
- **Monetization** (1-10): How likely are users to pay?
- **Feasibility** (1-10): How achievable is a solution?

### 3. Competition Analysis
- What existing solutions are mentioned?
- Why are current solutions failing users?
- What would differentiate a new solution?

## Response Format
Return a JSON object with synthesized opportunities:

```json

  "opportunities": [
    {{
      "title": "Short, catchy opportunity title",
      "description": "2-3 paragraph description of the opportunity",

    }}

}}
```

## Guidelines
- Focus on the top 5-10 most promising opportunities
- Be specific about target users - "developers" is too broad; "backend engineers at Series A startups" is better
- Include concrete evidence from the discussions
- Suggest realistic next steps for validation
- Note any concerning signals (e.g., "This space has many failed startups")
